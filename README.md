# Marathon Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes marathon race data using Python. It explores trends, distributions, and performance metrics of marathon runners using **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Seaborn** for visualization.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis of marathon times
- Visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots
- Insights on pace, gender distribution, and finishing times

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (for data handling)
- **Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Matplotlib** (for additional plotting)

## Setup Instructions
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MarathonAnalysis.git
cd MarathonAnalysis

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib

# Run the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook Marathonanalysis.ipynb
```

## Dataset
This project uses marathon race data, including:
- A primary marathon dataset.
- **The Big Dataset of Ultra Marathon Running** from Kaggle: [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633)

Ensure you have the relevant CSV files before running the analysis.

## Results
- Key insights on runner performance
- Visual representations of different metrics
- Possible factors affecting finishing times
